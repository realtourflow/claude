/**
 * Shared constants + helpers for the DealDetail tab/modal modules (#87).
 *
 * These were module-level in DealDetail.tsx before the god-component was split.
 * They live here because they're referenced by more than one of the extracted
 * files (or, like ClosingDaysBadge / STAGE_GATE, were defined in one cluster but
 * consumed by another). Pure cut-paste — no behavior change.
