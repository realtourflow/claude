/**
 * Fast Pass catalog — the server's source of truth for enrollment pricing
 * (#78). Mirrors lib/smooth-exit-catalog.ts.
 *
 * POST /deals/[id]/fastpass computes the Stripe charge from this table and
 * ignores any client-supplied total_cents, so a tampered request can't enroll
 * for a penny. This is a deliberate divergence from the Go EnrollFastPass
 * (backend/internal/handlers/enrollment.go), which trusted the client's
 * total_cents.
 *
 * Unlike Smooth Exit (where only the add-ons go through Stripe), the Fast Pass
 * charge is the base fee PLUS any selected upsells — matching what the Go
 * handler billed and what the UI shows. The UI list in lib/fast-pass-display.ts
 * derives its displayed dollar prices from these cents, so what the user sees
 * is what the server charges.

 * premium is charged on what they actually defer. So a discounted at_closing
 * enrollment costs `round((subtotal − discount) × 1.15)`.

 * `paymentOption` is the whitelisted enrollment option (`now` | `at_closing` |
 * `seller_concession`); only `at_closing` adds AT_CLOSING_PREMIUM, applied once.

 * this stays the single source of the markup so the survey never re-derives it
 * (#280). Passing no `discountCents` returns #280's plain (undiscounted)
 * behavior, so pre-#281 callers — the route's un-promo'd path and the survey
 * preview — are unaffected.
