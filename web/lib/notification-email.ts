/**
 * FF1 — best-effort notification emails on top of lib/email.ts.
 *
 * These helpers add best-effort EMAIL delivery for deal activity — new messages,
 * document uploads, task assignments, and offer requests. The matching in-app
 * `notifications` rows are persisted separately by the routes via
 * lib/notifications.ts (#290 wired up the document-upload and task-assignment
 * rows this header used to claim existed but did not). Each helper:
 *   - resolves recipients server-side from the deal (agent_id + deal_participants),
 *   - never emails the actor (sender / uploader / assigner),
 *   - is invoked best-effort by the route: a throw must never block the mutation
 *     (the route wraps the call in a try/catch that swallows — see the routes).
 *
 * The deep link is RECIPIENT-ROLE-AWARE: the app has no single per-deal route
 * shared across roles. Agents/admins use the agent deal route (`/agent/deals/:id`);
 * buyers and sellers land on their own portal (`/buyer/:userId`, `/seller/:userId`),
 * which is the only client deal view and is keyed by the user, not the deal; TCs
 * use the TC deals dashboard. A client-facing email must NOT link to the agent-only
 * route. The origin is taken from the request (`protocol://host`) so links work
 * across local / preview / prod without a hardcoded scheme.
 *
 * Preference / opt-out (#292): the Settings → Notifications "Email
 * notifications" toggle persists to `user_settings.settings.notifications.email`.
 * Every send here is gated PER-RECIPIENT on that key via `lib/notification-prefs`
 * — opted-out recipients are skipped while everyone else in the same fan-out
 * still gets theirs. It stays DEFAULT-ON: a missing row/key means "not yet
 * configured", which is opted-in (matching the Settings UI default).
